// PortPrefilterScanTimeout deliberately reuses protocol_probes' own
// PeekTimeout value rather than introducing a new, untested, possibly
// -shorter one - shortening timeouts trades real data quality (false
// negatives on slow-but-legitimate hosts) for speed, a tradeoff not
// agreed to in the design this package's port-prefilter logic comes
// from. A TCP connect (SYN -> SYN-ACK round trip) is a fundamentally
// faster operation than waiting for an application-layer banner, so
// this value functions as a safety ceiling for filtered/black-holed
// ports here, not a tight, latency-sensitive budget.

// maxConcurrentPortsPerIP bounds how many of a single IP's own ports
// get connect-attempted at once. Deliberately not unbounded -
// launching one goroutine per port for a broad sweep, all at once, for
// a single IP, would create very large instantaneous connection
// counts for a stage whose entire purpose is to be a cheap, early
// filter rather than a new bottleneck of its own.
//
// This value has a real, confirmed history worth knowing before
// changing it again. Originally 25. Briefly raised to 100 to reduce
// how long a single scan could take, after a live goroutine dump
// showed http_probes' fqdn_endpoint.go handler slots blocked inside a
// single scan simultaneously. That raise directly caused a severe,
// confirmed regression at real scale: port_prefilter runs at
// support.HighHandlerInstances (32) concurrent handler instances, so
// 32 x 100 = 3,200 peak simultaneous connections - verified, via
// `docker exec engine sh -c 'ulimit -n'`, to exceed the deployment's
// then-current 1,024 file-descriptor ceiling by a wide margin, versus
// 32 x 25 = 800 at the original value, comfortably under it. The
// practical effect was total, sustained silence across the entire
// engine, not just this stage - scanPorts never acquires the shared,
// session-wide NetSem semaphore at all (a deliberate exemption, see
// below), so nothing else in the system caught this before every
// dial() attempt, from any plugin needing a socket, started failing.
// Reverted to 25 for that reason, paired with shrinking the configured
// port range itself (nmap-top-1000 down to nmap-top-100).
//
// Now 100 again, but on a different footing: the file-descriptor
// ceiling that made the earlier raise fatal has been removed. The
// engine container is deployed with an explicit nofile limit of 8,192
// (compose.yaml), confirmed at runtime by the same `ulimit -n` check
// that originally diagnosed the failure. Full worst-case arithmetic at
// this value: 32 x 100 = 3,200 from port_prefilter's own handler,
// 16 x 100 = 1,600 from http_probes' fqdn_endpoint (which scans its
// resolved IPs sequentially, so 100 per slot, not per IP), plus
// NetSem's own 500 - roughly 5,300 against 8,192, leaving about 35%
// headroom.
//
// The measurement that motivated it: at 25, with a 100-port list, a
// cold scan runs four sequential batches of PortPrefilterScanTimeout,
// so ~8s per IP. A live run showed fqdn_endpoint's 16 handler slots
// averaging 9.4s of occupancy per event - saturated, doing almost
// nothing but scanning - which stalled service detection entirely
// (NetSem idle at 0/500 while Service, URL, TLSCertificate and Product
// counts flatlined, since scanPorts holds a slot without holding a
// NetSem token). At 100, one batch covers the whole list, so the same
// scan is ~2s and those slots return to HTTP probing between scans.
//
// Worth being explicit: scanPorts acquires Session.ScanSem (cap
// MaxScanConns=3200), not NetSem. NetSem stays the HTTP/API budget.
// ScanSem is what the dashboard reports separately from NetSem.

// EnsureOpenPortsScanned is the single, shared entry point for the
// connect-scan pre-filter, callable from either port_prefilter's own
// IPAddress-triggered handler or http_probes' fqdn_endpoint.go acting
// on a specific, already-resolved IP ahead of that handler. Returns
// whatever ports are confirmed open on ent (expected to be an
// IPAddress) - scanning fresh if this IP hasn't been checked within
// the TTL window yet, or returning the already-cached result
// (support.OpenPortsForIP) if it has, regardless of which caller
// originally triggered that earlier scan.
//
// Independently checks scope for this specific ent before doing
// anything else, on every call, regardless of caller - necessary
// because http_probes' own FQDN-triggered path lives on a completely
// separate pipeline from port_prefilter's IPAddress-triggered one,
// with no ordering guarantee between them (verified directly against
// engine/registry/pipelines.go's own BuildAssetPipeline: ordering is
// only guaranteed within a single EventType's own pipeline, not
// across two different ones). A given IP's own in-scope status isn't
// intrinsic to the IP - it depends on whether ip_netblock.go has
// already registered its containing netblock, which is guaranteed to
// have already happened via port_prefilter's own IPAddress-pipeline
// position, but is not guaranteed yet when reached via a resolved
// FQDN on the separate FQDN pipeline. Skipping an IP whose scope
// status hasn't resolved yet on this specific call is the safe,
// conservative choice - the same in-scope IP still gets scanned
// reliably later via its own, guaranteed IPAddress-triggered path
// regardless, so this is never a permanent coverage gap, only ever a
// difference in which call happens to do the work first.
//
// Concurrent calls for the same IP (its own IPAddress-triggered
// invocation racing one or more FQDN-triggered ones that happen to
// resolve to it) are collapsed via singleflight, keyed on the
// entity's own database ID - the same kind of check-then-act race
// bgptools' own netblock/autsys lookup()-before-query() pattern
// guards against with a mutex, applied here with a purpose-built tool
// instead of a hand-rolled lock, since x/sync/singleflight was
// already an indirect dependency of this module.
// PrefilterTTLStartTime returns the cutoff before which a stored
// open_port property is considered stale. It is the single source of

// whether an IP needs rescanning at all, and the passive consumers
// (http_probes' ipaddr_endpoint, protocol_probes) use the same value
// when reading results back, so "we did not rescan because the data is
// fresh" and "this is the data we consider fresh" can never disagree.
//
// Deriving both from one call also means the window follows the
// IPAddress->IPAddress transformation's configured TTL automatically,
// rather than needing a second constant kept in sync by hand.
